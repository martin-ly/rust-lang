# Compound and Composite Data Types

## Compound Data Types

- **Definition**: Compound data types, also known as complex data types, are data types that can store multiple values of different data types in a single structure. They are essentially a collection of primitive data types.
- **Examples**: Arrays, lists, classes, and structures. For instance, an array can hold multiple values of the same type, while a class in object-oriented programming can hold multiple values of different types.

## Composite Data Types

- **Definition**: Composite data types are a type of data structure that combines multiple individual data elements into a single unit. They are typically composed of two or more primitive data types, such as integers, characters, booleans, or floating-point numbers, arranged in a specific order.
- **Examples**: In the C programming language, a struct is a common example of a composite data type. A struct allows programmers to define their own data type by grouping multiple variables together.

## Key Differences

- **Structure**: Compound data types can store multiple values, possibly of different data types, in a single structure, while composite data types combine multiple individual data elements into a single unit.
- **Usage**: Compound data types are used to create more complex data structures and algorithms, enabling programmers to solve more complex problems. Composite data types are used to model complex entities in a more intuitive and natural way, simplifying the design and implementation process.
- **Abstraction**: Composite data types offer a high level of abstraction, allowing developers to focus on the logical structure of the data rather than managing individual data elements separately. Compound data types, while also providing abstraction, are more focused on the combination of different data types into a single structure.
